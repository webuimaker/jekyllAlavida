## What is the therapy for?

The medicine helps reduce cravings,  while therapy provides motivation to continue treatment, take medications, and observe what triggers and feelings are related to drinking from various points of view. When alcohol consumption is reduced, therapy also helps find pleasure in everyday experiences to replace the feelings alcohol would be generating, and plan a new life free of dependence upon alcohol.
