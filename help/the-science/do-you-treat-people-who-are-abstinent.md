## Do you treat people who are abstinent ?

Alavida does not encourage or promote consumption. For people that are abstinent prior to joining Alavida, we can provide them a very valuable set of tools and skills that will decrease the intensity and harm of their consumption should they begin to drink alcohol again, but in individuals that have been abstinent for a period of time our clinicians communicate clearly that abstinence is the best and healthiest thing they can do for themselves.  The difference between Alavida and traditional programs is that the recovery is not one-size-fits-all.
If they are in treatment with Alavida, they can choose abstinence if they and their care team decide that is the best option for them.
