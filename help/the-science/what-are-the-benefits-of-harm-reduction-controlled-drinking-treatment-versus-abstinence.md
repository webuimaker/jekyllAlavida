## What are the benefits of harm reduction controlled drinking treatment versus abstinence ?

Abstinence is the best and healthiest thing a person can do for themselves. The challenge is that many heavy drinkers do not want or feel they can achieve abstinence. At Alavida we feel that if you are not ready to commit to a lifetime of complete abstinence, that should not keep you from getting help. Harm reduction strategies can be an extremely effective way to deal with heavy drinking. Approaching the problem this way empowers more people to change, despite having  family, social or work settings where alcohol is present. Because it allows people to try various alternatives, it also gives them the option to decide what works best for them, increasing the chances of maintaining stable change and potentially even becoming a stepping stone towards abstinence.
