## How does the therapy work ?

We use a combination of therapy, counselling and support, tailored to the client's needs. As the medication starts to work, and drinking reduces, the therapy helps to create new behaviors and a new reward system so that change can be long lasting. It can include Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), both of which have been successful in treating heavy drinking. MET helps clients with rapid, internally-motivated change while CBT helps clients change patterns of thinking and behavior. The combination of both care team and the technology is what makes Alavida so effective.
