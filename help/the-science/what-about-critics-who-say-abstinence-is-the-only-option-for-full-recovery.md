## What about critics who say abstinence is the only option for full recovery ?

Abstinence is certainly an option, but many people aren't ready or wanting abstinence as a goal.  Studies show that about 1 of every 15 people who enter abstinence-based programs become and stay sober*.  We allow people to determine what their goals are, and have seen amazing results since launching in 2016: 82.5%*  reported feeling more in control of their drinking and significantly improved their ability to stop drinking.
