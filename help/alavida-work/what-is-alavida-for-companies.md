## What is Alavida for Companies ?

Alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorders alone costs the United States approximately $249 billion in lost productivity. Through mindful tracking and reinforcement, Alavida is known to have helped 82.5%* of its clients feel more in control of their drinking and significantly improve their ability to stop drinking which is critical for employee well-being and productivity. 

We understand that change isn’t easy, but it should be simple. Created to help people change their relationship with alcohol, Alavida is a modern, outpatient treatment for heavy drinking. Medical, therapeutic and technology elements combine to create a treatment that decreases alcohol cravings and can help the affected members of your team regain control in as little as 6 months. 

**Because we treat clients virtually, your employees  don’t have to take any time away from work while undergoing treatment!** We don’t require any abstinence goals or detox. Everything remains private and confidential, while your employees gain help through our evidence-based program, and you can track their progress at a high-level.
