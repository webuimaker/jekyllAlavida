Excited to attend my first [Ãšll conference](http://2015.ull.ie/)! The event officially starts tomorrow Monday 30 March. But the conference organizers thoughtfully booked a whole private train to take many of us from Dublin's [Heuston Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Heuston_railway_station) to Killarney today. The train was full of fellow attendees, [several](https://twitter.com/settern/status/582161917839564800) of [whom](https://twitter.com/tmaes/status/582194128320106496) compared this ride to the one [at the beginning of Harry Potter](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Platform_Nine_and_Three-Quarters).
