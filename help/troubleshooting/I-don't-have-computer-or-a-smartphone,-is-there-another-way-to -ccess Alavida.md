## I don't have a computer or a smartphone, is there another way to access Alavida ?

There are 2 main reasons  for not being able to get into your account: 1) If you forgot your password, you can reset it right below the login bar. 2) If you are accessing your diary, you will be required to input your birthdate. Depending on your device settings, it may be month, date, year, OR date, month and year. If you have tried inputting your birth month first, or date first, and you still can't access, please call 1 888 315 3634 or email us at: [(info@alavida.co)](mailto:info@alavida.co)! and we will help.
