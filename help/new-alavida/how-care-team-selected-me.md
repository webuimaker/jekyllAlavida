## How is my care team selected for me ?

Your care team will include a physician, therapist and coordinator. Treatment is tailored to your needs, and the professionals are selected based on your initial assessment prior to initiating treatment. They work hand in hand to help provide you with the best possible care throughout your treatment. The physician helps identify and monitor the physical effects, while the therapist identifies psychological effects of heavy drinking. Together, they help you identify your drinking goals, alcohol intake, analyze your health,prescribe medication accordingly and track your overall treatment. The coordinator helps acts as a communicator between various sections of your treatment and ensures your journey is smooth all the way.
