## Who qualifies for treatment

Most people qualify for the treatment. During an initial visit, clients will be screened for specific exceptions. Passing the screening should not be a problem unless you are:

- In the middle of a severe binge that incapacitates and interferes with program adherence
- Living with acute liver diseases
