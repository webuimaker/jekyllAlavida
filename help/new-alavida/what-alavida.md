## What is Alavida?

Alavida is a modern private outpatient treatment program for anyone who struggles with alcohol use. You can change your relationship with alcohol with the help of professionals, based on your own goals, be it to drink less or quit. It is composed of 3 main elements: medical, therapeutic and technology. The medical portion allows you to reduce the desire to drink, the therapeutic helps you replace those positive rewards from alcohol with other, healthier rewards, and the technology allows you to track and share your medication use, triggers, and alcohol intake with your care team. To get started, you can schedule an appointment with a physician. During this supportive and non-judgmental encounter, you will have the opportunity to get answers to your questions from a professional experienced in addiction medicine that can help identify your goals, and chart a potential treatment course.
