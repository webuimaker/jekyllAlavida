## What’s included in the treatment package ?

Our treatment is based on helping the brain gradually unlearn drinking behaviours. We do this through a combination of therapy, medication and technology. We guide clients through the stages of stabilization, maintenance, and continuing care. All our programs include 1-on-1 sessions with your individual doctor and therapist, the support of a care coordinator, and access to our diary platform, to help you track alcohol use and associated triggers and share with your care team in real-time for a tailored treatment. The medication is not provided or included in your treatment package, and with our prescription, it can be purchased at your local pharmacy. The total length of the program varies as it is tailored to you, but on average the treatment lasts 6 months with 18 months of continuing care. Depending on the program you are in, additional features may apply, such as family coaching and a private session with your individual dietitian specialized in the nutritional needs from problem drinking.
