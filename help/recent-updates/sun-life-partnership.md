## Sun Life partnership

Alavida is now a partner on Sun Life's new digital health community. Due to this, Sunlife employees and clients  get a $1000 credit, that goes directly towards the program, without the need to send any request and without disclosing additional information other than a SunLife identification document. This is irrespective of SunLife’s coverage. We can help you with information to try to get total coverage, however it’s important we let you know it could take time, and could be totally, partially or not approved at all - this is entirely up to the benefits provider on a case-by-case situation.
