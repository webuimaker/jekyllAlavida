## I'm not ready to start treatment, can I just book a consult first ?

Yes, you have the option of booking a consult with a doctor. It's a detailed conversation where a doctor specializing in addiction medicine will help identify your goals and chart a potential course. For scheduling it, we take a $100 payment (+GST in Canada). If you choose to join the program, 100% is returned to you as a reduction to your total cost. To book now,  call (1 888 315 3634) or click here: ([(Canada)](http://bit.ly/ALAVIDACA)! - [(USA)](http://bit.ly/ALAVIDAUS)! )
